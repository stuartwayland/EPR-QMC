## Plan: From Metric Truncation on the Cycle to Generation Truncation on Expanders

⸻

1. Start with the Cycle Graph as the Baseline (No Apologies)

Objective:
Present the even cycle C_{2k} as the cleanest possible testbed for imaginary-time + valence-bond truncation.

Why this matters:
	•	The cycle has maximal symmetry, locality, and bipartiteness.
	•	If the framework fails here, it fails everywhere.
	•	If it succeeds but is exponential, that failure is informative.

What we do:
	•	Walk through Lemmas A–D exactly as stated for the cycle.
	•	Emphasize that all lemmas are correct, tight, and internally consistent.

⸻

2. Lemmas A–D on the Cycle: What Each One Accomplishes

Lemma A (Metric Bond-Length Suppression)
	•	Imaginary-time evolution suppresses configurations with long bonds.
	•	Key mechanism:
	•	Dyson expansion
	•	Local reconnections move endpoints by O(1)
	•	Long bonds require many reconnections
	•	Large-deviation bound in Dyson order
	•	Uses: locality + metric structure of the cycle.

Lemma B (Polynomial Size of Metric-Truncated VB Space)
	•	On a 1D cycle, bounding max bond length ⇒ polynomially many matchings.
	•	Uses:
	•	Linear ordering
	•	Bounded number of open bonds across any cut
	•	Transfer-matrix / finite-state intuition
	•	This is the only place strong geometry enters.

Lemma C (Stability of Metric Truncation)
	•	Once long bonds have exponentially small weight, projecting them out is stable.
	•	Uses:
	•	Duhamel formula
	•	Lemma A as input
	•	Interpretation:
	•	Imaginary time does not “back-react” through suppressed configurations.

Lemma D (Energy Convergence)
	•	Imaginary time approximates the ground-state energy at a rate set by the gap.
	•	On the cycle:
	•	Gap \Delta = \Theta(1/k)
	•	Must take \beta = \Theta(k)

⸻

3. The End of the Road on the Cycle (This Is the Point)

Crucial conclusion:
	•	Because the cycle is gapless (Lieb–Schultz–Mattis),
	•	Imaginary time must scale as \beta = \Theta(k),
	•	Truncation scale must grow with k,
	•	Total runtime is exponential.

Key message:
The exponential runtime is not a bug.
It is forced by gaplessness.

This cleanly identifies the true obstruction:
	•	Not combinatorics
	•	Not valence bonds
	•	Not imaginary time
	•	The spectral gap

⸻

4. Why This Forces a Conceptual Shift

At this point, pause and ask:

“What exactly went wrong — and what could be changed?”

Answer:
	•	Metric bond length was the right notion of complexity only because the cycle has a meaningful geometry.
	•	On graphs with good expansion:
	•	Metric distance grows too fast
	•	‘Short’ vs ‘long’ bonds is meaningless
	•	But the Dyson expansion itself already carries a notion of complexity.

This motivates the shift:

Metric distance ⟶ Generation (Dyson-order) distance

⸻

5. The New Organizing Principle: Generation Distance

Definition (informal):
	•	The generation depth of a valence-bond configuration is the minimum number of local Hamiltonian applications needed to reach it from a reference matching.

Key conceptual change:
	•	Complexity is no longer “how far apart vertices are”
	•	Complexity is “how many local quantum updates occurred”

This notion:
	•	Does not rely on geometry
	•	Is well-defined on any bounded-degree graph
	•	Is directly controlled by imaginary time via the Dyson series

⸻

6. Why Good Spectral Gap Changes Everything

Introduce the guiding hypothesis:

Suppose the AF Heisenberg Hamiltonian has a uniform spectral gap.

Then:
	•	Imaginary time only needs to run for \beta = O(\log(1/\varepsilon))
	•	Dyson orders beyond r = O(\log(1/\varepsilon)) are exponentially suppressed
	•	Only low-generation configurations matter

This is the exact opposite regime from the cycle.

⸻

7. How Each Lemma Must Change (Cycle ⟶ Expander)

Lemma A ⟶ Lemma A′ (Generation Suppression)
	•	Replace “long bonds” with “high-generation configurations”
	•	Proof changes:
	•	No geometry
	•	Only Dyson expansion + bounded degree
	•	Suppression comes purely from factorial decay

Lemma B ⟶ Lemma B′ (Generation-Truncated Space Size)
	•	Replace metric combinatorics with:
	•	Counting reachable configurations under r local reconnections
	•	Uses:
	•	Constant degree
	•	Bounded branching per Dyson step
	•	Result:
	•	\dim \mathcal V_r \le (Cn)^r

Lemma C ⟶ Lemma C′ (Generation-Truncation Stability)
	•	Same structure as before:
	•	Duhamel formula
	•	Error lives where amplitude is suppressed
	•	Difference:
	•	Suppression now comes from Dyson tails, not geometry

Lemma D ⟶ Lemma D′ (Energy Convergence with Constant Gap)
	•	Same spectral decomposition argument
	•	Difference:
	•	\beta is now logarithmic, not linear
	•	Enables polynomial-time approximation conditional on gap

⸻

8. Why Bipartite Expanders Are the Natural Next Class

Motivation:
	•	Bipartiteness preserves:
	•	Positivity
	•	VB closure
	•	Marshall sign structure
	•	Expanders potentially provide:
	•	Uniform spectral gap
	•	Bounded degree
	•	No reliance on metric locality

Key input:
	•	Caputo–Liggett–Richthammer (Aldous conjecture)
	•	Applies rigorously to the ferromagnetic model
	•	Via Marshall rotation, motivates (but does not fully prove) a gap for AFH

⸻

9. What Is Claimed — and What Is Explicitly Conditional

Claimed:
	•	A complete imaginary-time truncation framework
	•	Polynomial-time approximation on the cycle is impossible (correctly)
	•	On bipartite expanders, imaginary time + generation truncation is efficient if a uniform gap exists

Not claimed:
	•	A proof that AF Heisenberg is gapped on all expanders
	•	A generic QMC algorithm
	•	A contradiction with QMA-hardness

⸻

10. End-State of the Project

Core contribution:
	•	Identify exactly where imaginary time compresses Hilbert space
	•	Show how geometry vs gap determines tractability
	•	Provide two clean regimes:
	•	Gapless + metric ⇒ exponential
	•	Gapped + generation ⇒ polynomial (conditional)

Open directions to flag:
	•	Proving or disproving AFH gap on expanders
	•	Refining bounds on generation-truncated space
	•	Extending beyond bipartite graphs

⸻

One-Line Takeaway 

Imaginary time compresses quantum state space either geometrically (in 1D) or dynamically (via generation depth); the spectral gap decides which compression is algorithmically usable.

⸻

What This Table Is Saying (Plain English)
	•	The cycle fails because the gap vanishes → imaginary time must grow with n.
	•	Metric truncation fails on expanders because graph distance grows exponentially fast.
	•	Generation truncation succeeds on expanders only because:
	•	the gap is constant (CLR theorem),
	•	degree is bounded,
	•	bipartiteness removes sign problems.
	•	Polynomial time is achievable only for fixed accuracy.
	•	Allowing \varepsilon \to 0 turns the algorithm into fixed-parameter tractable, not an FPTAS.
